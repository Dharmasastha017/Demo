Dharmasastha,

I am very happy to read your introduction. It is wonderful to see your honesty in sharing how you initially wanted to choose ECE but later accepted CSE with an open mind. Life sometimes takes us in unexpected directions, but it is our attitude that makes all the difference — and you have already shown maturity by embracing your stream and deciding to grow in it.

Your dream of becoming an entrepreneur and starting your own company is inspiring. It shows that you are not only thinking about your studies but also about creating opportunities for others. That vision, combined with consistent effort, will surely take you a long way.

I also appreciate that you have already started learning Python and shown interest in improving your coding skills. Remember, no one is born a great coder — it comes step by step, with practice and patience. Do not be afraid of challenges; every problem you solve makes you stronger and more confident.

Thank you for trusting me with your learning. I promise to guide you patiently, so that you not only understand coding but also start enjoying it. Keep your curiosity alive, stay consistent, and believe in yourself.

I am confident, Dharmasastha, that you will achieve your dream of becoming a successful entrepreneur and make your family proud. This is just the beginning of your journey, and I am excited to see you grow.
